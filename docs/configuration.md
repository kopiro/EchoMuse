# Configuration Guide

Every setting, what it actually does, and when you'd touch it — in plain
language.

## Where settings live

- **Fleet config** (gear icon → Fleet Config): the defaults every device
  uses.
- **Per-device config** (device page → Config tab): each section carries its
  own **Fleet / Device** switch in its header.

Scoping is **per section**, not all-or-nothing. Leave a section on *Fleet*
and it keeps following the fleet-wide value, including future changes. Flip
it to *Device* and only that section becomes this device's own — everything
else carries on tracking the fleet.

So a Dot in a small room can have its own **Ring** scene and its own
**Microphones** gain while still picking up every fleet change to the wake
word, EQ and Bluetooth settings. Before this, one override forked *all* the
settings and froze them against fleet changes permanently.

A section showing *Fleet* is displayed read-only rather than hidden, so you
can always see what it is inheriting. The banner at the top of the tab
summarises — `Fleet`, or `Local override (2 of 6)` with the sections named —
and **Revert all to fleet** puts everything back.

Flipping a section back to *Fleet* **discards** the values it was holding.
There is no hidden shadow copy waiting to reappear if you flip it to *Device*
again months later; it starts from the fleet value.

Changes apply **immediately** — no restarts, no rebuilds. The Config tab
opens with the device's **network (WiFi)** settings at the top — always
per-device, never inherited from the fleet — followed by the
fleet-inheritable sections, in order of how often you'll realistically touch
them: **Playback**, **Wake word**, **Microphones**, **Ring**, **Advanced**,
**Bluetooth**.

The **CPU** meter shows the core count beside the percentage — "27% · 2/4
cores". The Dot has four CPU cores and parks the ones it isn't using, and the
percentage is a share of the cores that are *awake*, so the same amount of
work reads as a bigger number when fewer are. Without the core count beside
it the figure can appear to halve when nothing actually changed.

Two other device tabs worth knowing: **Status** (IP, firmware, WiFi network,
ESPHome port, current volume, whether the config is fleet or overridden,
resource meters including **Latency** (the round trip to the device — amber
past 200ms, red past 1s; the only link-health signal the Echo's WiFi driver
actually provides, since it reports no retry or noise figures) and **Temp**
(the Dot's CPU sensor, and the hottest of its eleven sensors when that's
meaningfully warmer; it idles around 33°C, so anything amber is genuinely
unusual — and if the chip's thermal governor ever starts capping CPU
capacity, this is where it says so), and the
Bluetooth-proxy diagnostics panel when enabled —
the Status row reads `Online`, or `Offline` with how long ago the device was
last heard from) and **Activity** (voice-turn history — what was heard, how it was
transcribed, wake-word scores, playback underruns, near-misses, and — if
**Save utterances** is on — the recorded audio of each turn, playable and
downloadable). Activity
history is stored in the controller's database, so it survives controller
and device restarts; hourly hardware trends (CPU, memory, WiFi signal) are
kept for 180 days and available via the API
(`/api/devices/{id}/activity?days=N`).

## 01 — Playback

How responses sound.

### Equalizer (8 faders + presets)
Shapes the tone of the voice responses, like the EQ on a stereo. The Dot's
little speaker is boomy and dull by default.

- **Flat** — no shaping.
- **Clarity** — boosts the upper-mid frequencies where speech intelligibility
  lives. Good default for voice.
- **Warmth** — gentle low-mid lift, softer top. Nicer for music-ish content.
- Drag any fader for a custom curve.

### Speech boost
An extra presence bump for spoken responses. Try it if responses sound
muffled from across the room.

### Volume
Volume **tracks what you actually use** and survives reboots: every change —
buttons, Home Assistant slider, wherever — is remembered by the controller
and restored when the device reconnects. Set it low in the evening and a
midnight power blip brings it back low.

There is no volume slider in this section. There used to be, and it was
misleading: the device only re-applies the stored level on the first config
push after it boots, so moving the slider did nothing until the device
restarted — and any real volume change overwrote it in the meantime. Volume
is remembered device state rather than a setting you dial in, so the current
level is now shown read-only on the **Status** tab. Change it from Home
Assistant or the device buttons.

It is also never inherited from the fleet, whatever the section's Fleet /
Device switch says — otherwise a device would come back at another room's
volume.

Mute is remembered too, but by the device itself: a muted Dot stays muted
through reboots, power cuts, and firmware updates — red ring and all —
whether or not the controller is reachable.

---

## 02 — Wake word

How the device decides you said the magic word. By default this work happens
on the controller, not the Dot — the Dot just streams audio to it. (The Dot
*can* now also score locally, but only as a shadow comparison that changes
nothing about behaviour — see **Score on device** below.)

### Wake word model
Which word wakes it: Hey Jarvis, Alexa, Hey Mycroft, or Hey Rhasspy. These
are pre-trained recognisers — you're picking a word, not training anything.
Pick one that doesn't collide with words you say a lot (and if your
household still talks to real Alexas, don't pick Alexa).

Want your own word? Train a model with `oww_forge/` (see its README), then
use the **+ Custom model** tile to upload the `.onnx` — it's stored in the
controller's data volume, appears as a tile next to the stock words, and
takes effect immediately on selection. The `×` on an unselected custom tile
deletes it.

### Arbitration window
With more than one Echo, saying the wake word in earshot of two of them
used to start two competing conversations. Now the **first device to hear
you answers immediately**, and any other device detecting the same word
within this window (default 700ms) quietly stands down.

There is **no latency cost**: the winner claims the turn on the spot rather
than waiting out the window, so a solo wake is exactly as fast as it was
before. The window only decides how long afterwards a second device counts
as "the same utterance". `0` disables it, and it never applies when only
one device is online.

An earlier version instead waited out the window and gave the turn to
whichever device heard you *best*. That was dropped: it taxed every wake by
~364ms even when nothing was competing, and field data showed the
signal-to-noise winner produced a *worse* transcript than the device that
simply heard you first.

### Sensitivity (Precise ↔ Eager)
The confidence bar the recogniser must clear.

- Toward **Precise**: fewer false wakes (it triggering off the TV), but it
  may ignore you sometimes.
- Toward **Eager**: catches you more reliably, but expect the occasional
  ghost activation.

**How to tune it**: the Status tab counts **near-misses** — moments where the
score came close but didn't trigger. If you're being ignored and see
near-misses climbing, move one step toward Eager. If it wakes up when nobody
spoke, move toward Precise.

### Barge-in
Lets the wake word **interrupt the assistant mid-turn** — say "Hey
Rhasspy, stop" while it's reading you a paragraph (or still thinking
about your last question) and it cuts off and listens. Off by default. **Turn on Echo cancel (AEC) first**: barge-in
works by leaving the microphones live while the device speaks, and AEC is
what stops it hearing itself. The **barge threshold** is the wake
confidence required during playback — and counter-intuitively it should be
much *lower* than the normal wake threshold (≈0.10 works well): the
speaker is far louder at the microphones than you are, so your voice
scores lower over playback than in a quiet room, while the device's own
(echo-cancelled) voice barely scores at all (0.002–0.003 measured since
v2.7.8). **0.05 is a good default** — you shouldn't need to raise your
voice much. Raise it if responses ever cut themselves off. (During the
silent *thinking* pause the normal wake sensitivity applies instead —
nothing is playing, so the low barge threshold isn't needed there.)

### Speex denoise
Runs a noise cleaner on the audio *only for wake-word scoring* (your actual
commands are untouched). Worth trying in rooms with constant background
noise (TV, air-con) if wake detection is unreliable there. Off by default —
it's a "try it and compare" option.

### Score on device (shadow)
Experimental, off by default, and **changes nothing about how the Dot
behaves**. With it on, the Echo runs the same wake-word model over the same
audio and reports what it *would* have detected. It never triggers a turn.

The point is to find out whether on-device detection is trustworthy before
anything depends on it. Each voice turn's row in **Activity** gains the
device's own score next to the controller's, and the per-device activity API
returns an agreement summary (how often they agreed, how far apart in
milliseconds, and crossings the device saw that never became a turn).

Three things to know before turning it on:

- **It needs files installed on the Dot** that aren't part of the firmware —
  ONNX Runtime plus the wake-word models, about 15MB, placed in
  `/data/local/share/echomuse/oww`. They're deliberately not shipped in the
  firmware image, because that would double both the download and the space
  each of the two firmware slots takes. Until they're there, the toggle does
  nothing and the device log says which file is missing.
- **It costs about half a CPU core, permanently**, because the wake stream is
  always on. Measured on an Echo Dot Gen 2 that has capacity for it — the mic
  pipeline was unaffected across hours of use, including during music
  playback — but enable it on **one device at a time** and watch the
  **Resources** panel on the Status tab.
- **It needs recent firmware.** The toggle is disabled and says so on Echos
  whose firmware predates the feature, rather than appearing to work.

## 03 — Microphones

How your voice gets captured. These settings were tuned carefully — the
presets are the only part most people should touch.

### Pickup presets (Omni / Front / Rear)
The Dot has 7 microphones. During a command, it can favour the mic closest
to your voice:

- **Omni** — use the centre mic for everything. The safe choice; also the
  fallback if directional pickup ever misbehaves.
- **Front / Rear** — permanently favour one side. For Dots against a wall or
  next to a TV: point the pickup *away* from the noise.
- With directional pickup on and no fixed direction, the device picks the
  mic automatically at each wake — see the pipeline doc's "lock-back"
  section.

### Advanced (inside the Microphones section)

**MICPGA / Digital gain** — hardware amplifier levels inside the Dot's audio
chips, matched to Amazon's own factory values. *Leave these alone* unless
you're deep-diving; wrong values can distort every mic at once.

**Mic gain (dB)** — the software gain applied to the raw 24-bit microphone
signal before anything else hears it. Default **24dB**, chosen from real
measurements (the Dot's raw capture is extremely quiet — without this boost,
speech recognition regularly failed). Raise only if a device in a very large
room still tests quiet; the device reports "clipped" samples in its log if
you've gone too far. Lower toward 0 if you ever see clipping.

**Beam angle / Beamforming** — the raw controls behind the pickup presets.
Beam angle `-1` means "choose automatically at each wake"; any other number
fixes the pickup direction in degrees (0 = the side with the volume-up
button, clockwise). The presets set both of these for you.

**Noise suppression** — cleans the audio sent to speech-to-text (and only
that — wake-word listening is untouched). It uses a small neural denoiser
(DTLN) running on the controller, so there's no load on the Dot. Helps most
with *steady* noise — fans, air-con, appliance hum — in rooms where
transcripts come back garbled. It does not remove other people talking or
the TV; pointing the beamformer away from them is the tool for that. Off by
default — turn it on per device and compare transcripts.

**Echo cancel (AEC)** — teaches the mics to *subtract the Dot's own voice*
from what they hear. Benefits: the device can hear you properly during and
right after its own responses (follow-up questions work much better), its
own speech can't confuse the listening logic, and it's what makes barge-in
possible. Off by default; turn it on per device and check the `[aec] att=`
lines in the device log show attenuation climbing during a response. Two
tuning knobs:

- **AEC delay** — alignment between what was played and what the mics
  heard. **Leave it at 0** — that's the measured correct value for this
  hardware (the mic pipeline's own buffering absorbs the speaker latency).
  Raising it can silently disable cancellation entirely.
- **AEC tail** — how much room echo/reverberation the canceller models.
  Default 300ms; raise toward 500 in big empty-sounding rooms.

**Save utterances** — keeps the audio of recent voice turns so you can
*listen* to what was sent for transcription. The **Activity** tab then shows
a ▶ (play here) and a ⤓ (download the WAV) on every turn that has a
recording.

What's saved is the audio **exactly as speech-to-text received it** — so if
**Noise suppression** is on, you're hearing the cleaned-up version, not the
raw microphone. That's deliberate: when a transcript comes back wrong, the
only recording that can explain it is the one the recogniser actually heard.

This is the honest way to answer "is my microphone any good?". Without it
you're guessing from a garbled transcript, which can't tell you whether the
room was noisy, the gain was too low, or the denoiser chewed a word. Thirty
seconds of listening usually settles it — and it's the only sensible way to
A/B **Mic gain**, the pickup presets, or **Noise suppression**, since you can
compare the same phrase before and after.

**Off by default, and worth thinking about before switching on.** This is the
only setting that stores recognisable speech on the controller. What's kept:
the **last 10 turns per device**, as plain WAV files in the controller's data
folder, each overwritten as newer ones arrive. Only the audio sent for
recognition is saved — never the always-on wake-word listening, which is
discarded continuously and never written anywhere.

Turning the setting back off stops new recordings immediately, but **leaves
the ones already saved where they are** — deliberately, so that switching off
doesn't destroy samples you were part-way through comparing. They stay until
newer recordings push them out (which needs the setting back on) or you
delete the device, which removes its recordings too. To clear them out sooner,
delete the files from the controller's `data/recordings/` folder.

A turn recorded a while ago may show no buttons — that just means its
recording has aged past the last 10 and the turn history has outlived it.

## 04 — Ring

The colours the LED ring uses during conversations. Scenes apply
instantly and can differ per device. On current firmware (v2.9+) the
device animates the ring itself — the controller sends one "play this
animation" instruction per state change, so the spinner stays perfectly
smooth regardless of WiFi or controller load, and while a response is
speaking the ring **throbs in time with the audio** (brightness follows
the actual level coming out of the speaker). If the controller ever
vanishes mid-conversation the ring times itself out rather than spinning
forever. Older firmware falls back to controller-rendered frames.

- **Standard** — the classic green.
- **Airy** — a pale, calm sky blue.
- **Malevolent** — deep crimson listening ring with an ember spinner.
- **Pride** — a rotating rainbow.
- **Custom** — pick your own **Listening** (solid ring while recording) and
  **Thinking** (spinner while processing) colours.

Two things never change, in every scene: the **red mute ring** (red always
means the microphones are off — it's a privacy indicator, not decoration)
and the cyan volume arc. The directional "which mic is listening" highlight
also adapts automatically: it brightens the scene's ring colour rather than
painting green.

The volume arc holds the ring for about two seconds so a turn animation
can't wipe it the instant it appears — but **pressing the action button
cancels it immediately**, so adjusting the volume and then talking to the
device still shows you the listening ring straight away.

### How a turn ends
The ring tells you *why* a conversation stopped, using rhythm rather than
colour (red, orange and cyan already mean mute, no-controller and volume):

- **One slow throb** — the device was listening and heard nothing.
- **A few quick blinks** — something went wrong (Home Assistant errored, or
  no speech came back).
- **Ring simply goes out** — normal end, or you cancelled it yourself.

The ring also now clears when the audio *actually* finishes, rather than
when the controller estimates it should have. On a slow WiFi link the old
estimate could clear the ring several seconds before the Dot had stopped
talking.

### Meter response (Advanced)
While a response plays the ring throbs with the live speaker level. The
**Advanced** panel here shapes how hard it throbs — the device renders it
locally, so changes apply on the next response with no restart:

- **Decay** — how fast it falls. Higher tracks individual syllables; lower
  reads as a slow swell.
- **Attack** — how fast it rises on a peak.
- **Gamma** — contrast. Higher makes the swing more visible.
- **Floor** — brightness during silence. `0` goes fully dark between words.
- **Reference** — the speaker level mapped to full brightness. Lower is more
  sensitive.
- **Curve** — below `1` lifts quiet consonants into view.

These are taste settings, which is exactly why they're adjustable here
rather than baked into firmware. The defaults are tuned for speech; if the
ring looks too static, raise **Decay** and **Gamma** first.

## 05 — Advanced

Everything in this section affects **only button-press conversations**
(holding the action button to talk without a wake word). Wake-word
conversations ignore all of it — they're managed by Home Assistant's own
speech detection.

### Turn processing

**Auto gain (AGC)** — automatically levels your voice volume on button
turns, so whispering and shouting come out similar. Harmless here; it's
deliberately never applied to wake-word listening (automatic gain drifting
with room noise was the root cause of a "stops responding after a few days"
bug, and it stays banished from that path).

### Speech gate

Decides when a button-press utterance starts and stops:

- **Threshold** — how loud counts as "speech". Measured in pre-gain units
  (the mic gain doesn't change what this number means). The default 0.001
  was validated by measurement; raise slightly (0.003–0.005) only in
  genuinely noisy rooms.
- **Speech gate (ms)** — how much continuous speech opens the gate. Higher =
  ignores brief noises, but clips fast talkers.
- **Silence gate (ms)** — how much silence ends your turn. Higher = you can
  pause mid-sentence without being cut off; lower = snappier responses. 900ms
  default; raise to ~1200 if you get cut off mid-thought.

Note (v2.9.4): these two timings now behave exactly as configured. Older
firmware quietly applied them ~5× longer than the number said (a counting
bug against the mic's real batch size), so button-press turns used to hang
on for a few seconds of silence before ending — if turns feel snappier
after updating, that's why, and if a slow talker now gets clipped, raise
the silence gate.

---

## 06 — Bluetooth

**Bluetooth proxy** — turns the Dot into a Home Assistant Bluetooth proxy.
The device passively listens for Bluetooth Low Energy advertisements
(presence beacons, BLE temperature/humidity sensors, phones and watches for
room-presence systems like Bermuda) and forwards them to Home Assistant.

In Home Assistant the proxy appears as a **separate ESPHome device** (named
`<label> BT Proxy`), independent of the voice assistant — you can add,
remove, or ignore it without touching the voice satellite. Once added, its
scanner feeds HA's Bluetooth integration exactly like an ESP32 Bluetooth
proxy would, and a diagnostic sensor counts received advertisements.

Two things to know before enabling:

- Enabling **permanently switches the Dot's Bluetooth chip away from
  Android's stack** (it survives reboots). Nothing EchoMuse uses needs
  Android Bluetooth — but stock-style Bluetooth speaker pairing stops being
  possible on that device.
- The proxy is **receive-only** (passive scanning). Devices that need an
  active connection to read data (some smart locks, older BLE devices)
  aren't supported — advert-based sensors and presence tracking are.

Diagnostics live on the device's **Status tab** (Bluetooth proxy panel):
scanner state, advertisements seen, nearby device count, and whether Home
Assistant is connected and receiving.

---

## WiFi (device page → Config tab, top section)

Move a device to a different WiFi network without touching ADB. The section
at the top of the Config tab shows the current network, signal, and IP, lets
you scan for visible networks, and switches with a confirmation step.

The switch is designed to be **unbrickable**: the device applies the change
itself and must pass three checks — join the network, get an IP, and
**reconnect to this controller** — before the change is kept. Fail any of
them (wrong passphrase, DHCP trouble, or a network that works but can't
reach the controller, like an isolated guest VLAN) and it automatically
restores the previous network and tells you why. Even a power cut
mid-switch recovers: an unconfirmed change is rolled back on boot. Allow
about two minutes for the device to drop off and come back.

---

## Controller settings (the `.env` file)

These are set once, on the server, and need a controller restart to change:

| Setting | What it is |
|---|---|
| `SERVER_IP` | The controller computer's LAN IP — what devices connect to. |
| `OWW_MODEL` / `OWW_THRESHOLD` | Startup defaults for wake word/sensitivity — the dashboard values override these. |
| `DEVICE_APPROVAL` | `strict` (you approve every new device — recommended) or `auto`. |
| `SERVER_TLS_PORT` | Encrypted device link (wss) port — default 8770, `0` disables. Devices switch to it automatically once they hold pushed credentials (wizard install, or the **Secure link** button on the device Status tab). |
| `REQUIRE_DEVICE_TLS` | Set to `1` **only after every device shows "wss (TLS)"** on its Status tab — from then on the controller rejects unencrypted or tokenless device connections. |

See `.env.example` for the complete list with comments.

### Encrypted device link

The controller generates its own certificate authority on first start
(stored in `tls/` next to the database) and listens for encrypted device
connections alongside the plain ones. Each device gets two credentials —
the CA certificate and a private token — installed automatically by the
provisioning wizard, or pushed to an existing device with the **Secure
link** button on its Status tab. A device with credentials connects
encrypted from its next reconnect; the Status tab's **Link** row shows
which mode each device is using. Once the whole fleet shows `wss (TLS)`,
set `REQUIRE_DEVICE_TLS=1` to lock out unencrypted connections entirely.
