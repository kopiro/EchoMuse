em_recordings.py — utterance audio capture for the Activity panel
==================================================================

Saves the mic audio of recent voice turns as WAV files so you can *listen*
to what the array actually captured, rather than inferring mic quality from
an STT transcript and a wake score. Asked for by users who wanted to judge
capture quality before spending an evening tuning micGainDb/AEC/NS.

Storage mirrors `em_oww_models`: files live in `recordings/` beside the
SQLite DB, so they sit inside the persisted Docker volume and survive image
upgrades. Retention is a hard per-device file count (KEEP_PER_DEVICE) —
utterances are the one artefact here that contains raw speech, so "a
bounded handful, then gone" is the point, not an optimisation. Pruning is
by turn id parsed out of the filename rather than mtime: ids are monotonic
rowids, so the order is exact even if the volume is restored from a backup
that flattened timestamps.

The audio written is exactly what the controller streamed to Home Assistant
for recognition — tapped BELOW noise suppression, so on a device with
`nsAsr` on the file is the denoised stream, not the raw mic. That is the
point: a recording that isn't what STT heard can tell you the room was
noisy but never why a transcript came back wrong. 16kHz mono S16_LE,
matching the ESPHome satellite wire format.

Pure path/filesystem logic (no aiohttp, no db import) so it can be unit
tested; em_esphome writes through it and em_api serves from it.
